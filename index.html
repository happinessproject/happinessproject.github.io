This site is a place where:
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
	<li>I will explore what happiness is and how to achieve it, hoping that my experiences will be a resource to you on your journey.</li>

	<li>I will address veganism (why it matters, how to go about making this lifestyle change one that sticks and why you'd want to do that, and how you as one individual person CAN make a difference).</li>

	<li>I will share my adventures. I believe that everyday can be an adventure, whether you're climbing up mountains or just eating lunch at a local coffee shop by yourself.</li>

	<Li>I hope to inspire you, and be inspired by you.</Li>
</ul>

<p>Expected launch date: TBD</p>
